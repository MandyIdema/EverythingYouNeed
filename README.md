# EverythingYouNeed

Are you tired of having to write your code? Well I have some for you that might be useful for your game project.

All of the files included are entirely free to use. As a third-year game design student I have done a lot of programming and I don't want to my hard work to never be used again after one project. In this repository I cover a range of basics which might be handy for your game project.

* Please note that these codefiles are meant to be implemented in Unity, any other engine will simply not work.
* I am still a student so my work might not be optimal yet.
* You may use these files for FREE in your game projects but if you simply copy everything do not pass them off as your own! (I'm looking at you fellow students...)
* You are always free to use snippets of the code and edit them to make them your own.

If you have any questions, I would love to help out. Just send me a message!
